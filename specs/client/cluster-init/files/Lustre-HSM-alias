Global alias have been created in /etc/bashrc as follows:

hsm_archive
  - defines a function to run 'find $(jetpack config lustre.mount_point) -type f -print0 | xargs -r0 -L 50 sudo lfs hsm_archive'
  - this command will "archive" all the files in your Lustre filesystem to Blob
  - files will not be "released" from Lustre
  - runs the "metastore" command to copy /lustre metadata to a file located at /lustre/metastore


hsm_restore
  - defines a function to run 'find $(jetpack config lustre.mount_point) -type f -print0 | xargs -r0 -L 50 sudo lfs hsm_restore'
  - when Lustre is started anew it will import all metadata from Blob but not file data
  - this command will "restore" all file data from Blob to Lustre
  - runs the "metastore" command to restore /lustre metadata from a file located at /lustre/metastore

hsm_state <grep argument>
  - find $(jetpack config lustre.mount_point) -type f -print0 | xargs -r0 -L 50 sudo lfs hsm_state | grep "$1" | wc -l
  - examples:
    -- hsm_state -i archive --> counts # of files archived to Blob
    -- hsm_state -v release --> counts # of files NOT released to Blob
    -- hsm_state -v archive --> counts # of files NOT archived to Blob
